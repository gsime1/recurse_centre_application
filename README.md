## Recurse Centre Application

Here are my two small programs for the Recurse Centre application. 

The specification for cracklepop are the following:

Write a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive). If the number is divisible by 3, print Crackle instead of the number. If it's divisible by 5, print Pop. If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print CracklePop. You can use any language.


The other program is the famous game of fifteen. I had conded a solution in C when for a problem set for a computer science course (CS50), which I tackled again in Python, using a functional paradigm. Here's the specs:

Implement the Game of Fifteen, per the below.
